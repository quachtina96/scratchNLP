when the program starts make a variable called x
delete variable x
make a variable called x and make a variable called y
set x to random number between 10 and 20
set y to 4 times six
change y by negative 3


when the green flag is clicked make a list called list for a single sprite and repeat play the bang sound 5 times and if x is equal to 1 broadcast alas the world is still in tact
when the down arrow is pressed broadcast and down we go
finally broadcast I am done
when the space key is pressed broadcast hello world 3 times then create a new variable called count
add 1 to count do that 5 times
if count is greater than zero, play the bing sound and change volume by 3 that's it
repeat the following 5 times increment y by 20 then decrement it by 1
say hello world y times
make a list called name for all the sprites
make a variable called name and set it to three then add this to name
if x is three first add two to name then make a variable called y then set y to 2.2 plus 1.8 finally add y to name that's it 
make a list called numbers
make a variable called i and set i to 0
add 1 to i then set the element i of list numbers to i repeat this ten times
first create a clone of myself then create a clone of it then delete the clone of it finally broadcast i am having an identity crisis that's it 

play the sound of music sound
if the timer is greater than 3 then firstly reset the timer secondly change volume by 10 thirdly change pitch effect by negative 5 that's it
if the timer is greater than 2 then stop all sounds that's it
when the program starts make a variable called x and make a variable called y and set x to 4 and set y to 2 times 3
if x plus y is equal to 3 then make variable count that's it otherwise first add 1 to x then subtract 1 from x finally make a variable z and set z to 4 that's it 
if y is equal to x then make a variable x that's it
